## 🚀 Features

- 🦾 **Quadruped Design** – 8 × SG90 servos for smooth leg movement  
- 🧠 **Arduino Nano** – Simple and easily programmable microcontroller  
- 🔋 **18650 Battery Power** – Rechargeable and portable  
- 🖥️ **OLED Display (SSD1306)** – Used for displaying expressions, system info, and fun animations  
- 🧩 **Modular Build** – You can easily modify 3D models and adapt the chassis for different electronics

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

1. **3D Print** the body parts from the provided STL files.  
2. **Assemble** the servos and wire them according to the circuit diagram.  
3. **Upload the Code** to the Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE.  
4. **Power Up** the bot with your 18650 batteries.  
5. Watch your **Spider** come alive!

> 💡 **Tip:** Modify the dimensions of your bot based on the components you’re using —  
> I used SG90 servos, 18650 batteries, and an Arduino Nano with an expansion board.
